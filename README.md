📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

🔍 Project Overview

In the era of information overload, distinguishing real from fake news is a major challenge for governments, media platforms, and the general public. This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning to build a robust fake news detection model using real-world labeled datasets. The ultimate goal is to support automated misinformation screening at scale, helping organizations make informed, trustworthy decisions.

The model can help media companies, fact-checkers, and online platforms automate the filtering of unreliable content and enhance the trustworthiness of information shared with the public.

🧪 Techniques Used

📊 Data Processing
	•	Combined two labeled datasets: Fake.csv and True.csv
	•	Merged, cleaned, and labeled data into a single structured dataset
	•	Removed punctuation, stopwords, and special characters
	•	Lowercased and tokenized text

📚 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	•	TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency):
	•	Converts unstructured text into a sparse matrix of weighted word frequencies.
	•	Helps in identifying important, non-common terms for classification.
	•	Text Preprocessing:
	•	Stopword removal (e.g., “the”, “and”, “is”)
	•	Lemmatization (optional enhancement)
	•	Tokenization and whitespace trimming

🤖 Machine Learning Models
	•	Passive Aggressive Classifier:
	•	Particularly effective for large-scale text classification
	•	Online learning (adapts with each batch of training)
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Multinomial Naive Bayes
	•	Support Vector Machine (optional)
	•	Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation

📈 Evaluation Metrics
	•	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
	•	Confusion Matrix Visualization
	•	Comparison across models with test data
