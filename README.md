üì∞ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

üîç Project Overview

With the growing concern over misinformation online, especially through news media, the ability to automatically detect fake news is increasingly vital. This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify news articles as fake or real using a labeled dataset.

The model can help media companies, fact-checkers, and online platforms automate the filtering of unreliable content and enhance the trustworthiness of information shared with the public.
